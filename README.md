AJAX Homework Assignment

## What's Left
- I am stuck on creating ten gifs for each index within my 'topics' array. What I get are gifs for all the indexes combined.
    - I can't tell if it is my for loop that makes this happen or the way my variables are written

- I believe my form submission works because it prints in the console but I can't seem to create the button for it. When I attempt to push it to either the 'topics' array or the jQuery variable to create new buttons, there is nothing produced from the form submission.

- Even though I could not get my gifs to render properly, I managed to have them in still form once clicked. However I faced the challenge in bringing it back to the animated version without having to hand code the same thing in multiple if else statements.
